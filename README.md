Description
This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount if the discount percentage is 20% or higher. If the discount is less than 20%, the original price is returned.

How It Works
A function calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) is defined to:
Apply the discount if it meets the 20% threshold.
Return the original price if the discount is below 20%.
The program prompts the user to input:
Original price of the item.
Discount percentage.
The program then calculates and prints:
The discounted price if applicable.
The original price if no discount is applied.

Usage
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter the original price and discount percentage when prompted.
View the final price in the output.
